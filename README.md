tf4java is a Java project that uses TensorFlow interface of java to invoke the trained model of python


## Step 1
generate dataset: normal, uniform, skewed distribution

## Step 2
calculate z-value and get sub-dataset

## Step 3
train a model

## Step 4
invoke the model by Java and compare with R*-tree
